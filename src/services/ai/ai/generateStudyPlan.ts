Generate a personalized, detailed SAT study plan using the following inputs:
- Current SAT score: ${data.currentScore}
- Target SAT score: ${data.targetScore}
- Days until test: ${daysUntilTest}

Requirements:
1. Create a day-by-day schedule from today until the test date (maximum 30 days).
2. For each day, include 2–3 unique study activities, each with:
   - topic (e.g., "Reading: Main Idea Questions", "Math: Quadratic Equations")
   - type (must be either "review" or "practice")
   - duration in minutes (integer)
   - description (50–100 words of specific instructions)

3. Ensure that each activity:
   - Reflects the user's personalization: ${data.personalization}
   - Includes steps that help achieve their personalization within their prep

Format:
Return ONLY a valid and complete JSON object in the EXACT structure below — nothing else.

{
  "days": [
    {
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "activities": [
        {
          "topic": "string",
          "type": "string - only one word",
          "duration": number,
          "description": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Do NOT include any explanation or notes before or after the JSON.
- Ensure there are no trailing commas or invalid characters.
- The response should be proper JSON that can be parsed by Javascript later on
